# Codility-Problems

The problems in the Cpp folder have the statements in the pictures as I could not use copy-paste on the website. The solutions are in the txt file, each solution starts with the comment //ProblemX, where X - is the problem number.

The problems are solved exclusively in C++ and maybe better solutions can be found! They are just possible solutions.
